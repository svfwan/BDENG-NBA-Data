By examining their statistics during their prime years, we seek to gain insights and compare their achievements on the basketball court. The analysis is based purely on statistics and official achievements, providing a data-driven perspective to evaluate the players' performance.

## Methodology behind Analysis

- **Domain Context:**
  To analyze the impact and value of a player, it is challenging to rely solely on numbers. However, certain statistical categories can provide valuable insights into a player's skills and effectiveness on the court. This analysis focuses on key categories such as points, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, effective field goal percentage, and true shooting percentage to understand the exceptional individual performances of Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James during their prime years.

- **Individual Impact:**
  The analysis begins by examining the selected key categories individually for each player. By comparing their performance in points, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, effective field goal percentage, and true shooting percentage, we aim to gain insights into their exceptional skills and contributions.

- **Comparison of Overall Impact:**
  After evaluating individual statistics, the analysis shifts to comparing the overall impact of the three players. Key categories such as team wins, defensive win shares, offensive win shares, win shares, player efficiency rating, and plus-minus are analyzed to determine their overall impact and how much they contributed to making their teams better.
